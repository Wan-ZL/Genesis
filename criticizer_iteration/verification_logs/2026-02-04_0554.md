## Verification Details

### Issue #21: Calendar Integration

**Status**: All 10 acceptance criteria PASSED

**Tests Performed:**
1. Ran calendar unit tests: 32 tests, 31 passed, 1 skipped (caldav not installed - expected)
2. Started AI Assistant with SYSTEM permission (ASSISTANT_PERMISSION_LEVEL=2)
3. Verified all 5 calendar tools registered: list_events, create_event, update_event, delete_event, find_free_time
4. Verified calendar settings exposed in API: calendar_caldav_url, calendar_username, calendar_password_masked, calendar_password_set, calendar_default, calendar_enabled
5. Tested error handling when caldav library not installed: Returns helpful message
6. Verified permission requirements: All tools require PermissionLevel.SYSTEM
7. Checked documentation exists: assistant/docs/CALENDAR_SETUP.md
8. Ran full test suite: 744 tests passed, 1 skipped, 3 warnings (non-critical)

**Evidence:**
- Server logs show all 5 calendar tools registered on startup
