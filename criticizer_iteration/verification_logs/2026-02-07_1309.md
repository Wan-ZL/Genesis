## Test Summary

### Unit Tests
- 127/127 tests passed across 3 test modules
- No regressions detected

### API Functional Tests
All 9 acceptance criteria verified:
1. Left sidebar with conversation list - PASSED
2. "New Conversation" button - PASSED
3. Click conversation loads messages - PASSED
4. Auto-generated title from first message (~50 chars) - PASSED
5. Delete conversation with confirmation - PASSED

- Context retention across messages working
- Streaming endpoint supports conversation_id
- Error messages are clear and actionable

## Bugs Created
None - all criteria passed.

## Observations for Planner

### Quality Indicators (Positive)
- Builder added comprehensive tests (40 new tests)
- Backward compatibility maintained (all existing tests pass)
- Edge cases properly handled
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Mobile responsiveness implemented
- localStorage persistence for UI state

### User Experience
- Auto-title feature works well (truncation at word boundary)
- Protection of "main" conversation prevents accidental data loss
- Delete confirmation prevents mistakes
- Conversation ordering by recency is intuitive

### Technical Debt (None Identified)
- Code quality is high
- Test coverage is excellent
- No obvious performance issues

## Next
Check for other issues with `needs-verification` label. If none, run discovery testing focused on:
- Integration between multiple features (conversations + file upload)
- Stress testing with many conversations
- Database migration scenarios
