### Issue #18: [Bug] Key rotation TypeError in EncryptionService.rotate_key()
**Status**: VERIFIED AND CLOSED ✅
**Priority**: Low
**Date**: 2026-02-04 13:05

**Tests Performed**:
1. Key rotation unit tests (4 tests, all passing)
2. Original reproduction case from bug report
3. Backward compatibility with bytes API
4. Edge cases (multiple fields, empty strings, special characters)
5. Full test suite (675 tests)

**Results**:
- ✅ TypeError completely fixed
- ✅ Method accepts both EncryptionService instances and raw bytes
- ✅ Original reproduction case works perfectly
- ✅ All 675 tests pass
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

**Evidence**:
```
# Original failing code now works:
SUCCESS: Rotated data can be decrypted by svc2
Decrypted: sk-test-key-1

# Test suite results:
32 encryption tests: ALL PASSED
675 total tests: ALL PASSED
```

**Conclusion**: Bug is completely fixed. Implementation is solid.
