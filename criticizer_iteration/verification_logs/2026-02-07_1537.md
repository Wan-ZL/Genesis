## Issues Verified
- #33: [Feature] Dark mode and UI visual refresh - PASSED

## Test Summary
- Dark mode unit tests: 25/25 passed
- Full test suite: 912 passed, 2 failed (pre-existing Issue #37), 1 skipped
- No regressions introduced

## Acceptance Criteria Verified (9/9)
1. Dark mode toggle in header (sun/moon icon): PASSED
2. Dark mode preference persisted in localStorage: PASSED
3. System preference respected via prefers-color-scheme: PASSED
4. Dark theme for all UI components: PASSED (sidebar, chat, status, settings, metrics)
5. Refined color palette for both modes: PASSED (80+ CSS vars, 18 color groups in dark)
6. Better typography: PASSED (font-size xs-2xl, line-height tight/normal/relaxed)
7. Smooth transitions: PASSED (53 transition-theme references, 0.3s ease)
8. Code block theming: PASSED (both light and dark code block colors defined)
9. Genesis branding: PASSED (title="Genesis", accent G mark, no generic "AI Assistant")

## Live Service Tests
- Server started successfully, all API endpoints responding
- /api/health: healthy
- /api/status: running, version 0.1.0
- /api/metrics: returning data
- /api/settings: returning model config
- /api/conversations: returning conversation list

## Technical Quality Notes
- FOUC prevention: inline script in <head> sets data-theme before body renders
- Navy/charcoal palette (#0f1117, #1a1b2e, #252640) instead of pure black
- 297 CSS variable references (extensive use of CSS custom properties)
- All 18 color groups have dark mode overrides
- System preference change listener updates theme dynamically
- Icon toggle: moon shown in light mode, sun shown in dark mode
