## Focus
Backlog item: Create supervisor service for 24/7 assistant runtime (launchd)

## Changes
- `assistant/service/com.genesis.assistant.plist`: Created launchd template
  - Configures Python to run server.main module
  - KeepAlive on crash or non-zero exit
  - Logs to ~/Library/Logs/Genesis/
  - Uses template variables for paths (substituted at install time)
- `assistant/service/assistant-service.sh`: Created management script
  - Commands: install, uninstall, start, stop, restart, status, logs
  - Auto-detects Python path
  - Substitutes paths into plist template during install
  - Shows service status and HTTP health check
- `assistant/server/routes/status.py`: Added /api/health endpoint
  - Simple {"status": "healthy"} response for service monitoring

## Testing
- All tests: 30/30 passed ✅
- Service script help: OK
- Status module import: OK

## Result
SUCCESS

## Next
Test the service: install and run it to verify 24/7 operation works. Then continue with Issue #1 (blocked on API key) or tool registry system.
