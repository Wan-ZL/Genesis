# Memory + State Rules

## Memory sources
- Constitution-level: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Modular rules: `.claude/rules/*.md`
- Dynamic memory: `claude_iteration/state.md`, `claude_iteration/runlog/*`, `claude_iteration/roadmap.md`

## claude_iteration/state.md must always include
1) Current focus (issue or backlog item)
2) What is done
3) What is next (single next step)
4) Known risks / blockers
5) Quick commands to reproduce / test
