## Memory sources
- Constitution-level: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Modular rules: `.claude/rules/*.md`
- Dynamic memory: `agent/state.md`, `agent/runlog/*`, `agent/roadmap.md`

## agent/state.md must always include
1) Current focus (issue or backlog item)
2) What is done
3) What is next (single next step)
4) Known risks / blockers
5) Quick commands to reproduce / test
