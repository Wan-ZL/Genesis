# Planner Runlog: 2026-02-11 12:00

## Session Type
Phase transition planning (Phase 6 complete -> Phase 7 start)

## Context
- Phase 6 ("From Tool to Teammate") is fully COMPLETE
- All 6 issues (#32-#37) verified and closed by Criticizer
- 969 tests, 100% pass rate (first time zero failures)
- Builder achieved 8 consecutive first-pass verifications
- Zero open issues -- critical inflection point requiring strategic direction

## Research Conducted

### Web Search Topics
1. AI assistant features users want most in 2026
2. Self-hosted AI assistant open source trends
3. OpenClaw/Clawdbot architecture and success factors
4. Psychology of AI assistant engagement and retention
5. Multi-channel messaging integration patterns
6. Proactive intelligence and Heartbeat patterns

### Key Findings
- **OpenClaw** exploded to 100K+ GitHub stars driven by: local-first + multi-channel + Heartbeat Engine (proactive checks)
- OpenClaw has 512 security vulnerabilities including CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8) -- Genesis can position as the SECURE alternative
- Proactive features increase engagement 40%+ (CHI 2025 research)
- Calendar reminders and daily briefings are highest-value, lowest-complexity starting points
- 73% of users won't discover features that require API calls (frontend-backend gap is a retention killer)
- The AI assistant market has split: Tier 1 (reactive chat) vs Tier 2 (proactive agents). Genesis sits between -- needs proactive capabilities

## Decisions Made

### ADR-003: Phase 7 Theme "Proactive Companion"
**Strategy**: Close the Gap, Then Leap Forward

**Part A: Close frontend-backend gap**
- #38 Persona switcher UI (CRITICAL) -- backend exists, UI missing
- #39 Syntax highlighting (HIGH) -- code assistance is a primary use case
- #42 Cross-conversation search (MEDIUM)
- #43 Message actions (MEDIUM)

**Part B: Proactive intelligence**
- #40 Notification system with Heartbeat Engine (HIGH)

**Part C: Tech debt**
- #41 Encryption cleanup (MEDIUM)

### Deferred to Phase 8
- Multi-channel messaging (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord) -- too complex now, but the biggest future differentiator
- Long-term memory patterns -- needs more conversation data
- Mobile native app -- PWA sufficient for now
- Email integration -- privacy complexity too high

### Product Decision
- Empty messages accepted as valid (allows users to "poke" the AI)

## Issues Created
1. **#38** - Persona switcher UI in chat interface (priority-critical)
2. **#39** - Code syntax highlighting with highlight.js (priority-high)
3. **#40** - Proactive notification system / Heartbeat Engine (priority-high)
4. **#41** - Encryption key management cleanup (priority-medium)
5. **#42** - Conversation search across all conversations (priority-medium)
6. **#43** - Message actions: copy, edit, regenerate, delete (priority-medium)

## Files Updated
- `planner_iteration/state.md` -- Phase 7 state
- `planner_iteration/roadmap.md` -- Phase 6 marked complete, Phase 7 and 8 added
- `planner_iteration/decisions/ADR-003-phase7-proactive-companion.md` -- Phase 7 decision record
- `planner_iteration/research/2026-02-11-proactive-intelligence-research.md` -- Research findings
- `claude_iteration/backlog.md` -- Updated with Phase 7 issues
- `VISION.md` -- Phase 6 complete, Phase 7 in progress

## Reflection

Genesis has come remarkably far. In 8 weeks:
- 37 issues completed, 969 tests, zero failures
- Full-featured AI assistant with multi-model support, tools, calendar, code analysis
- Multi-conversation, dark mode, personas, keyboard shortcuts
- Self-evolving multi-agent system (Builder + Criticizer + Planner)

But the truth is: Genesis is still a capable tool, not a beloved companion. The gap between what the backend can do and what users can actually access is the most immediate problem. The persona system is invisible. Code blocks are monochrome. Messages cannot be copied or regenerated.

The proactive notification system is the feature that will transform Genesis from "something I use when I need it" to "something that reaches out to me when I need it." This is the difference between a tool and a companion.

Phase 7 priority order: #38 > #39 > #40 > #41 > #42 > #43

## Next
- Builder should start with #38 (Persona switcher UI)
- Review after #38 is verified or after 3 issues closed
- Maximum 1 week between reviews
