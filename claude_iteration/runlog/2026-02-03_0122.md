## Focus
Close Issue #1 and update rules for issue lifecycle management

## Changes
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: Added rule to run `./stop-loop.sh` when no issues and backlog empty
- `.claude/rules/02-workflow.md`: Added rule to close issues when acceptance criteria met
- `claude_iteration/state.md`: Updated to reflect Issue #1 closed
- Closed GitHub Issue #1 with completion summary

## Rule Changes Made
1. **Auto-close issues**: When all acceptance criteria are met, close the issue with `gh issue close`
2. **Auto-stop loop**: When no GitHub Issues AND backlog is empty, run `./stop-loop.sh` and exit

## Result
SUCCESS

## Next
No open issues, backlog complete. Loop should stop per new rules.
