  - GET /api/file/{file_id}/content - Get file content as base64
  - GET /api/files - List all uploaded files
- `assistant/server/routes/chat.py`: Extended to support multimodal messages:
  - Added `file_ids` parameter to ChatMessage

  - Messages with images are sent as multimodal content to GPT-4o
- `assistant/server/main.py`: Registered upload router

- `assistant/ui/style.css`: Added styles for file preview and attach button
- `assistant/ui/app.js`: Added file upload and preview functionality
