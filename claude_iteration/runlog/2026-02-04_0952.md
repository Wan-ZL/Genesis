# Run Log: 2026-02-04 09:52

## Focus
Check for available work items

## Changes
- `claude_iteration/runlog/2026-02-04_0952.md`: This run log

## Findings
1. **GitHub Issues**: None open
2. **Backlog review**:
   - High priority: "Activate Claude API" - Requires user action (add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
   - Medium priority: All items complete
   - Low priority: All items complete
   - Ideas: Unscoped - need to be converted to GitHub Issues first

## Result
SUCCESS (no actionable work available)

## Next
Per contract: "If no GitHub Issues AND backlog is empty/all-done, run `./stop-loop.sh` and exit."

Loop will be stopped. To continue development:
1. Create a GitHub Issue with acceptance criteria, OR
2. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to enable Claude API, OR
3. Convert one of the unscoped ideas into a GitHub Issue:
   - Integration with calendar/tasks
   - Automated PR review suggestions
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Conversation export/import
