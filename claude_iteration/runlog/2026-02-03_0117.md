## Focus
Add voice input support using Web Speech API (from backlog, Low priority)

## Changes
- `assistant/ui/index.html`: Added voice button (🎤) next to attach button
- `assistant/ui/app.js`: Implemented speech recognition functionality
  - `initVoiceInput()` - Initialize Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)
  - `toggleVoiceInput()` - Start/stop recording
  - `startVoiceInput()` / `stopVoiceInput()` - Manage recording state
  - Continuous mode with interim results for real-time transcription
  - Graceful fallback: hides button if browser doesn't support speech API
  - Error handling for permission denied and other errors
- `assistant/ui/style.css`: Added voice button styling
  - Recording state with red background and pulse animation
  - Mobile-friendly touch targets (44px minimum)

## Testing
- All 122 tests pass
- HTML syntax verified
- JavaScript syntax verified

## Result
SUCCESS

## Next
Voice input complete. All backlog items done. Issue #1 is code-complete (API key is user-dependent).
