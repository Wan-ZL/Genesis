# Run Log: 2026-02-03 02:44

## Focus
Check for next work item after Issue #2 completion

## Changes
- `claude_iteration/state.md`: Verified status (already updated to reflect awaiting user input)
- `claude_iteration/runlog/2026-02-03_0244.md`: This run log

## Findings
1. GitHub Issues: None open (Issue #2 was already closed)
2. Backlog review:
   - High priority: "Activate Claude API" - Requires user action (add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
   - Medium priority: All items complete
   - Low priority: All items complete
   - Ideas: Unscoped - need to be converted to GitHub Issues

## Result
SUCCESS (no actionable work available)

## Next
Per contract: "If no GitHub Issues AND backlog is empty/all-done, run `./stop-loop.sh` and exit."

Loop will be stopped. To continue development:
1. Create a GitHub Issue with acceptance criteria, OR
2. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to enable Claude API, OR
3. Convert one of the unscoped ideas into a GitHub Issue:
   - Integration with calendar/tasks
   - Automated PR review suggestions
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Conversation export/import
