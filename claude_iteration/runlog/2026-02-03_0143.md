## Focus
Fix metrics dashboard: Success Rate 0% and incorrect data paths (Issue #3)

## Changes
- `assistant/ui/app.js`: Fixed loadMetrics() function
  - Success rate now correctly calculated as `(total - errors) / total * 100`
  - Latency now reads from correct path `data.latency.overall.avg` (was expecting `data.latency_ms.average`)
- `assistant/ui/index.html`: Added tooltips to clarify each metric
  - Requests: "Total API requests to /api/chat since service start"
  - Success Rate: "Percentage of API requests that succeeded without errors"
  - Avg Latency: "Average response time for chat API requests"
  - Messages: "Total messages stored across all conversations (user + assistant)"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Success Rate bug**: Frontend expected `data.requests.success` field which doesn't exist. Backend provides `requests.total` and `errors.total` separately.
2. **Latency bug**: Frontend expected `data.latency_ms.average` but backend provides `data.latency.overall.avg`.
3. **Messages count**: Was already correct (counts rows in messages table). The "286" count reported in issue likely included messages from previous test conversations.

## Metrics Persistence Behavior (verified)
- Request/latency/error metrics: RESET on service restart (in-memory)
- Message count: PERSISTS across restarts (SQLite database)

## Testing
- All 122 tests pass
- JavaScript syntax verified
- HTML syntax verified

## Result
SUCCESS
