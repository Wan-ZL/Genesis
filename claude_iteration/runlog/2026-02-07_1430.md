## Result
SUCCESS

## Key Decisions
1. Phase 6 theme: "From Tool to Teammate" -- focus on UX, not more backend features
2. Conversation sidebar is the single most impactful change
3. Deferred: Slack/Discord, email, proactive intelligence (Phase 7)
4. ADR-002 accepted for Phase 6 direction

## Research Summary
- Every successful AI assistant in 2026 has: multi-conversation, dark mode, custom persona
- Self-hosted users value: privacy, offline, unlimited customization
- Proactive intelligence is the next frontier but needs stable multi-conversation model first
- Genesis's UI is the weakest link -- technically solid but visually forgettable

## Next
Builder should start Issue #32 (Conversation sidebar) as the highest-priority work item.
