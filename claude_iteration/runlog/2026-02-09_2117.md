## Focus
Implemented self-healing mechanism for Genesis autonomous loop - heartbeat detection, circuit breaker, and zombie cleanup.

## Changes
- `~/.local/bin/genesis-heartbeat.sh`: Created heartbeat script that updates `/tmp/genesis_heartbeat.json` on each tool call
- `~/.claude/settings.json`: Added PostToolUse hook for heartbeat + BASH timeout env vars (30min default, 2hr max)
- `start-multi-agent-loop.sh`: Rewrote with self-healing mechanisms:
  - `check_heartbeat_stale()`: Detects agents stuck for 15+ minutes
  - `run_agent_with_heartbeat()`: Monitors Claude in background, kills if stuck
  - `cleanup_zombie_processes()`: Cleans up stuck pytest/server processes
  - `init_circuit_breaker()` / `check_circuit_breaker()`: Stops loop after 5 iterations with no git changes
- `orchestrator/README.md`: Documentation for the self-healing system

## Result
SUCCESS

## Next
Test the mechanism by running the multi-agent loop and verifying:
1. Heartbeat updates during normal operation
2. Circuit breaker detects no-progress iterations
3. Stuck agents are properly terminated after 15 minutes
